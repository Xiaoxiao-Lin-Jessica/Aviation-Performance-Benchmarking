# Controllers Directory

## Overview
This directory contains the controller classes of the application. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, invoke business logic, return views or data, and manage the control flow of the application.

## What to put here:
1. **REST Controllers**: Classes annotated with `@RestController` that handle RESTful API endpoints.
2. **View Controllers**: Classes that return views, typically annotated with `@Controller`.
3. **Exception Handlers**: Classes or methods that handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses.
