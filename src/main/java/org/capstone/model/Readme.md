# Model Directory

## Overview
This directory contains classes that represent the data models of the application. These classes define the structure of the data, its relationships, and its constraints.

## What to put here:
1. **Entity Classes**: Classes annotated with `@Entity` that represent database tables.
2. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Objects used to transfer data between processes or layers.
3. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity.
