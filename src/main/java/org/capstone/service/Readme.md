# Service Directory

## Overview
This directory contains service classes that encapsulate business logic, calculations, and database calls. Services act as a bridge between controllers and repositories.

## What to put here:
1. **Business Logic**: Methods that implement the core functionality of the application.
2. **Database Transactions**: Methods that handle database transactions, typically annotated with `@Transactional`.
3. **Utility Methods**: Helper methods or calculations that are used throughout the application.
